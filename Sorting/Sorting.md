##Observations

###Bubble sort
* After every iteration, we get the next maximum or minimum.
* Best case time: O(N)
* Worst case time: O(N^2)
* The order of duplicate elements are maintained.

###Selection Sort
* Select a element and put it at its correct index.
* Best case time: O(N^2)
* Worst case time: O(N^2)
* The order of duplicate elements are not maintained.

###Insertion Sort
* Taking each elements and inserts it in the correct position.
* Best case time: O(N)
* Worst case time: O(N^2)
* Number of checks is reduced, compared to Bubble Sort.
* The order of duplicate elements are maintained.
* Works good when array is partially sorted.

###Cyclic Sort
* When given numbers are from 1 to N.
* Best case time: O(N)
* Worst case time: O(N)
